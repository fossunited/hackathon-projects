### Rules

Please be concise in explaining what your project does, how to install it, test it, and use it. Similarly, write concise and meaningful commit messages that show the progression of the project.
- **Completeness:** Applications must be complete and working.
- **Design and aesthetics:** If you are making a user interface, try and ensure that they are clean, modern, and usable.
- **Timeframe:** The project must be reasonably built within the given timeframe. The judgement of the jury will be final in this.
- **Credits:** If you are using existing code, make sure you credit it. Plagiarism, which is all too common unfortunately, is strictly not appreciated.
